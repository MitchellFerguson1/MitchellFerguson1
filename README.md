# Who am I?

Hello there. I'm currently a Computer Science major at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Some of my coursework involves mobile applications, web applications, and artificial intelligence along with some database courses.

My current goal is to gain an internship for the summer of 2021 that will hopefully grow into a career opportunity. I am currently set to graduate December 2021.

# What have I done?

This is my Github page, so you should be able to find most of my projects close by. Most work is done on Car Care, DCP Bucket List, aMAZEing, and a few other applications that I've worked on with friends for fun.

Feel free to look around.
