# Who am I?

Hello there. I'm currently a Computer Science major at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Some of my coursework involves mobile applications, web applications, and artificial intelligence along with some database courses.

# What have I done?

This is my Github page, so you should be able to find most of my projects close by. Most work is done on Car Care, DCP Bucket List, aMAZEing, and a few other applications that I've worked on with friends for fun.

Feel free to look around.
